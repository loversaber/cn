重新阅读了RNAi的两位诺贝尔获奖者的演讲稿，应该算不上是论文研读，但也没别的类别可写，就放在这个目录下吧。

**1. return to the RNAi world: rethinking gene expression and evolution**

这是CC Mello的演讲稿，介绍了发现RNAi机制中的标志性事件。Mello有个女儿，是一型糖尿病患者。

> In the year 2000 our daughter Victoria was born. In an unfortunate twist of fate, Victoria developed type-one diabetes in the fall of 2001. Suddenly, I had to learn how to inject into a human, my own daughter, for the first time. Ironically, human insulin, the same bacterially synthesized molecule that inspired me to pursue molecular biology, is now giving Victoria her very life. This experience has given me a new perspective on the importance of medical research. Edit, who is a wonderful nurse, is now taking care of Victoria, and serving as a diabetes counselor for newly diagnosed families.
